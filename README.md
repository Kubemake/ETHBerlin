# ETH3 hackathon Berlin

Description:

The NFT Defragmenter allows you to split any NFT of any ERC721 contract into any number of parts.
The parts that appear as a result of the split are fully compatible with the ERC20 standard (the contract creates a unique ERC20 contract), in fact, these are also tokens. 
The number of tokens is determined upon split by the original owner of the NFT. 
Tokens can be used in exactly the same way as regular ERC20. 
The NFT token itself is locked on the fragmentator contract.
The owner of 100% ERC20 tokens can at any time defragment them back into an NFT token and take it for himself, while all ERC20 tokens are burned.
